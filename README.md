# Land-Registration-System-using-Blockchain

The **Blockchain-Based Secure Land Registration System** is a decentralized solution designed to overcome the limitations of the existing land registration system. This project leverages the **Ethereum blockchain** and **smart contracts** to create a transparent, secure, and efficient platform for land registration and ownership transfer.

## Problem Statement

The current land registration process is slow, inconvenient, and prone to:

- Disputes and corruption due to vulnerabilities in manual paperwork.
- High costs due to intermediaries like property dealers.
- Lack of transparency in the transfer of ownership.
- Insecure and untraceable processes that lead to fraud.

## Solution Overview

This project proposes a secure land registry system based on **Ethereum blockchain technology**, ensuring:

- **Decentralization**: Eliminates the need for intermediaries.
- **Immutability**: Ensures that all transactions are tamper-proof and permanent.
- **Transparency**: Provides a traceable history of land ownership transfers.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Reduces expenses by automating processes using smart contracts.
